THE FIX
=======

  SMMU CR0 Register (0x0b010020)

  Before: 0x1D = 0001 1101
                      |
                 bit 2 = 1 (EVTQEN enabled)
                      |
                      v
            Event queue processes
            events and fires IRQ
            ~130 times per second

  After:  0x19 = 0001 1001
                      |
                 bit 2 = 0 (EVTQEN disabled)
                      |
                      v
            Event queue silent,
            IRQ never fires,
            CPU0 freed up,
            network stack healthy
